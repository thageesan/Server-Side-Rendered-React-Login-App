# Login App

This project is built using React and Node with mongodb as the database.  The react is server side rendered.  You will be able to access the application by running the development server.  To test the login mechanism with user data uncomment lines in the app listen callback function found in the `server.js`.

## Install
Run `npm run install` to install all the packages required to build, deploy & test the application.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/`, `view/`, & `assets/` directory.


## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/api/login`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  *Note: You need to have mongo db setup on your machine.



## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha).
